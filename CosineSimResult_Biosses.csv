96,"GATA2 is also of considerable interest; genetic ablation leads to tumor regression in mouse models of adenocarcinoma of the lung, and whereas this transcription factor may appear to be the least druggable of targets, its role in regulating the proteasome suggested therapeutic approaches that appear very promising","The GATA2 transcription factor, which is essential for oncogenic K-ras-dependent lung tumor development, binds to the TRAF6 promoter and enhances its expression.",1.7999999523162842,0.44999998807907104,0.9350325,0.9226904,0.88046664,0.8365317,0.85670733,0.6417751

98,"The researchers screened human NSCLC cell lines carrying either wild-type or mutant KRAS with an RNAi library against 7,000 human genes.","Recently, it was shown that Gata2 fulfills such role in mutant Kras induced NSCLC.",1.7999999523162842,0.44999998807907104,0.91886306,0.92128354,0.8873082,0.88041866,0.80094755,0.6069805
99,"The Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 induces regression of solid tumors  and its derivatives are in the early clinical phase as cancer therapeutics; however, it targets Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1, which induces resistance against apoptotic cell death triggered by ABT-737.","Recently, it has been reported that ABT-737 is not cytotoxic to all tumors cells, and that chemoresistance to ABT-737 is dependent on appreciable levels of Mcl-1 expression, the one Bcl-2 family member it does not effectively inhibit.",3.0,0.75,0.96972686,0.9552252,0.96271163,0.9305545,0.94352984,0.8339485
